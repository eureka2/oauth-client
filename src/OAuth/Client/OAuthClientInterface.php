	 * using the authenticate function, or by directly setting the variables
	 * access_token, as well as access_token_secret in case of using OAuth 1.0 or 1.0a services.
	 * The response_status variable returns the HTTP response status of the request.
	 * The responseHeaders variable returns the HTTP response headers.
	 * The responseBody variable returns the HTTP response body.

	 * @param array $parameters Associative array with the names and values of the API call request parameters.

	 * @param array $options Associative array with additional options to configure the request.
	 *
	 * Currently it supports the following options:
	 *
	 * - '2legged'                : boolean option that determines if the API request should be 2 legged. The default value is false.
	 * - 'accept'                 : content type value of the Accept HTTP header to be sent in the API call HTTP request.
	 *                              Some APIs require that a certain value be sent to specify
	 *                              which version of the API is being called. The default value is '*&#47;*'.
	 * - 'accept_language'        : value of the Accept-Language HTTP header to be sent in the API call HTTP request.
	 *                              Some APIs require that a certain value be sent to specify
	 *                              which version of the API is being called.
	 * - 'convert_json_to_array'  : boolean option that determines if objects should be converted into arrays when the
	 *                              response is returned in JSON format. The default value is false.
	 * - 'convert_xml_to_object'  : name of the method to convert XML responses. Currently only 'simplexml' is supported. It makes a
	 *                              XML response be parsed and returned as a SimpleXMLElement object.
	 * - 'fail_on_access_error'   : boolean option that determines if this functions should fail when the provider
	 *                              response status is not between 200 and 299. The default value is false.

	 *                              The array indexes must have the same name of the parameters
	 *                              to be sent as files. The respective array entry values must
	 *                              also be associative arrays with the parameters for each file.
	 *                              Currently it supports the following parameters:
	 *
	 *                              - 'type' MIME value of the content type of the file.
	 *                              - 'filename' defines a custom file name for the file to be uploaded. Default: none
	 *                              - 'contents' optional, the contents of the file
	 *
	 * - 'post_data_in_uri'     : boolean option to determine that a POST request should pass the request data in the URI. The default value is false.
	 * - 'max_redirects'        : limit number of times that HTTP response redirects will be followed. If it is set to 0, redirection responses fail in error. The default value is 0.
	 * - 'body'                 : request body data of a custom type. The 'request_content_type' option must be specified, so the 'body' option is considered.
	 * - 'request_content_type' : content type that should be used to send the request values. It can be either
	 *                            'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' for sending values like from Web forms, or
	 *                            'application/json' for sending the values encoded in JSON format.
	 *                            The default value is 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.
	 * - 'headers'              : associative array of custom headers to be sent with the API call.
	 *                            These headers override any values set by the class when sending the API call HTTP request.
	 * - 'resource'             : string with a label that will be used in the error messages and debug log entries to identify what operation the request is performing.
	 *                            The default value is 'API call'.
	 * - 'response_content_type': content type that should be considered when decoding the API request response.
	 *                            This overrides the Content-Type header returned by the server.
	 *                            If the content type is 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' the function will parse the data returning an array of key-value pairs.
	 *                            If the content type is 'application/json' the response will be decode as a JSON-encoded data type.
	 *                            Other content type values will make the function return the original response value as it was returned from the server.
	 *                            The default value for this option is to use what the server returned in the Content-Type header.
	 *
	 *
	 * @return mixed Return the value of the API response. If the value is
	 * JSON encoded, this function will decode it and return the value
	 * converted to respective types. If the value is form encoded,
	 * this function will decode the response and return it as an
	 * array. Otherwise, the class will return the value as a string.
	 * This function returns false if the call was not done successfully.
